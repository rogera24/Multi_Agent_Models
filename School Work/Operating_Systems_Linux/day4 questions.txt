1) a-c) I noticed that it takes another number for the inonumber for the soft link but uses the same for the hard link. They still are the
	same file though. If one is touched so is the other. 

2) The changes are present because it is the same file.

3) Yes the changes are present because they are the same files.

4) My soft link has no ability to cat anything but the hard link still has the file data. The soft link was only a shortcut to the data were
	as the hard link was an actual copy.

5) Poem and poem3 have the same contents but poem2 has old contents because poem2 was an exact copy and 3 was a shortcut to it.

6) My computer states I cannot make a soft link with msdos, running as admin overloads the buffer for cmd, so I cant even see the files in the list.

7) If I drag the file it opens the file, if I drag the shortvut, it tries to open the cmd command in text and reads out symbols.

9) Well it says that it a C Source file. It doesnt recognize junk because it is just plain text when it looked at it. I noticed that it picks
	up on any line of code that it can compile and build like the main loop or the #include.
