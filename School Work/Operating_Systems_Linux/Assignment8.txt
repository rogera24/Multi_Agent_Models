My Mutex thread had a 1:18.805 ratio or, .154 seconds to 2.896 seconds ratio.

All the threads do not get equal counts. The threads play round robin a little but not a full round the robin. They are off by at most 100,000.

They do execute randomly at each lock. My counts show that they do differ.

The Mutex helped to schedule the processes the best that it could but in fact it just made sure the number was correct and that it got "close"
	to the goal of 3,000,000 which it never hit. It always went over the count by two or three.
